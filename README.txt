This is a mock messaging web application using ASP.NET

This application does not connect to a database, so then this project can be
downloaded and run from any computer with Visual Studio. Since it does not
connect to a database there is a file called TEMPDATA.cs that contains temporary
model data that is used in the application.

How to run:
Download the repository and open the DemoWebsite.sln file using Visual Studio 2015 or
Visual Studio 2017. Then hit the run button.

How it works:
The Home tab includes a header and a body text box that allow you to post a message to
your friends. It also includes a list of all posts from your friends.

The Messages tab includes a list of friends you have a private conversation with. If
you click on a name it will bring you to the conversation where you will be able to send
a message with a header and a body.

The Account tab includes personal information about the logged in user.
